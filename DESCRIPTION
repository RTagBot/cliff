Package: git
Title: A Simple Wrapper for Git Command Line
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Randy",
           family = "Lai",
           role = c("aut", "cre", "cph"),
           email = "randy.cs.lai@gmail.com")
Description: While "git2r" and "gert" provide excellent bindings to the "libgit2" library,
    they do not provide all functionalities that the git command line offers. This simple
    wrapper of the git command line exposes the git command line to the R interface and
    allows R users to invoke git commands directly from R. One will find this package useful
    if they need to perform complicated git operations locally.

Description: While 'git2r' and 'gert' provide excellent bindings to the 'libgit2' library,
    they do not cover all functionalities that the git command line offers. This simple
    wrapper of the git command line exposes the git command line to R and allows users to 
    invoke git commands directly from R. Readers should keep in mind that
    there are performance tradeoffs to use the wrapped command line instead of using directly
    the efficient 'libgit2' library. In addition, user authentication cannot not handled seamlessly.
    In most situations, this should be only considered if 'git2r' or 'gert' do not satisfy the needs.

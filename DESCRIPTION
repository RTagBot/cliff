Title: Execute Command Line Programs Interactively
Version: 0.1.1
Authors@R:
    person(given = "Randy",
           family = "Lai",
           role = c("aut", "cre", "cph"),
           email = "randy.cs.lai@gmail.com")
Description: Execute command line programs and format results for interactive usage. It is based on the package 'processx' so it supports additional features such as timeout and reading from stdin when compared with 'system()' and 'system2()'. It also provides a simpler and cleaner interface than 'processx::run()'.
